Summary

The advantages or disadvantage of refactoring code

Advantage:
Improve the code quality
Fasten the period

Disadvantages:
Only can use for replacing certain text
High quality for original copy of code


Apply to refactoring the original VBA script
For VBA script, there are lots of ways to improve the code quality and make the code more accurate, such as using formula, recording Marco in worksheets, and so on. In this way, the way how we make the code will be faster than before.

However, the original copy should be more flexible and accurate, which is really import. Since the change will be on the base of original copy of VBA code, we should understand the original functions as well.
