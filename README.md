Overview of project: Explain the purpose of this analysis

Steve’s parents are trying to invest in green energy, such as hydroelectricity, wind energy, geothermal energy, bioenergy and so on. They are about to invest all money into DAQO (DQ) New Energy Corp who makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Steve has been asked to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO’s stock. 

Through refactoring the VBA code, different years have been analyzed. The results of 2017 and 2018 will be a suggestion for Steve’s parents to do the investment with DQ or with another green energy company.
